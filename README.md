## UpLearn Exercise

Write a function fetch(url) that fetches the page corresponding to the url and returns an object
that has the following attributes:
+ assets - an array of urls present in the `<img>` tags on the page
+ links - an array of urls present in the `<a>` tags on the page

Assume that the code will run on a server. Assume that this work is a part of a web app that
needs to be built further by multiple development teams and will be maintained and evolved for
several years in the future. In addition to these, make any assumptions necessary, but list those
assumptions explicitly.
